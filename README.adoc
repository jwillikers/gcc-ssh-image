A container image for running the {GCC} toolchain from an {OpenSSH} server, built on {Fedora}.
Comes complete with CMake, Conan, Ninja, and Clang tools.

== Synopsis

This container is meant to be used with IDE's that support remote development over SSH, such as {CLion} and {Visual Studio Code}.
You might find this workflow particularly helpful if you develop on an immutable base operating system, such as {Fedora Silverblue}.

Supported architectures:: `amd64`, `arm32v7`, `arm64v8`
User:: user
Password:: password

== Quick Start

To use the GCC toolchain inside the container, execute commands via {Podman}.

[source,sh]
----
➜ podman run --rm -p 2222:22 --volume "$HOME":/home/user:Z -dt --name gcc-ssh quay.io/jwillikers/gcc-ssh:latest
----

== Build

This project uses {Buildah} and {Podman} for building and testing the image.
To ensure the shell scripts are kept in good working order, the project uses ShellCheck and shfmt.
A set of pre-commit checks are readily available to ensure your code is up-to-spec before it is committed.
Both ShellCheck and shfmt are run via Podman using their official Docker containers as pre-commit hooks.
Cool, right?
Instructions for setting up a development environment, building the image, and testing the image follow.
These instructions are intended for users of {Fedora-Silverblue}, where the packages `buildah`, `git`, and `podman` are already available.

I should probably just provide a container with a Bash development environment, shouldn't I?
While I'm thinking about, putting pre-commit and Git in their own container may not be a bad idea if I can get Podman-in-Podman working.
